## Asymptotic analysis of an iterative algorithm:
1. Define the problem size (input size), N
2. Count the number of the primitive operations as a function of N.
3. Determine the growth rate of the function.
## Analysis for recursive algorithms:
1. Write a recurrence equation for running time function (analyze function and find equation)
2. Solve the recurrence equation (use a table and find a pattern)
3. Classify the result to an Θ(f(n)) family (use proof by induction or The Master Theorem)
## Proof by Induction Example

## Master Theorem
Usable when T(n) is of the form: T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n), if n >= d
Where:
* a is the # of subproblems 
* n/b is the size of the subproblems 
* f(n) is any additional primitive operations.

Steps: 
1. Calculate N^log_b(a)
2. Find the O(f(n))
3. Find the case and specific values and use The Master Theorem.
