## Big O - (O)
Big O provides an **upper bound** on the growth rate of a function. It describes the worst-case complexity of an algorithm by giving the maximum amount of time or space it could take for large inputs.

## Big Omega - (Ω)
Big Omega provides a **lower bound** on the growth rate of a function. It describes the best-case complexity of an algorithm.

## Big Theta - (Θ)
Big Theta provides a **tight bound** on the growth rate of a function. It describes an algorithm's complexity when the upper and lower bounds are the same.

### Little o - (o)
Little o provides a **strict upper bound** on the growth rate of a function. It describes functions that grow strictly slower than a given function.
