## What is it?
Trie is a tree-based data structure for sorting strings in order to support fast pattern matching.
**There are different types of tries: e.g. standard trie, compressed trie, and suffix trie.**
* To construct a trie, a set of strings (S) from a finite alphabet Σ is given, and no string in the set is the prefix of another string in the set.

A standard trie is an ordered tree with the following properties:
- Each node, except root, is labeled with one character from Σ;
- The ordering of the child nodes of an internal node is determined by the ordering of Σ;
- Each leaf node is associated with a string in the set S.
- No two child nodes of one internal node are marked with the same label.

A compressed trie is a trie that compresses redundant nodes (the nodes with exactly one child node) together.

A suffix trie is a trie that is constructed using one string. The set of the strings are the suffix strings of the given string. Both standard trie and compressed trie can be used to construct the suffix trie.

## Main Operations:
N is the length of the string parameter.
Insert - insert a new word into the trie - O(N)
Search - Searching for a word in the trie - O(N)
Delete - remove a word from the trie - O(N)
## Ways to implement (with code): 
As it is a tree ADT, pointer-based implementations are the best.

## Typical applications:
* Tries can be used to perform both exact string matching and prefix matching.
* Information retrieval (especially search engine indexing) 
* Lempel-Ziv encoding.
* Computational biology
* Longest prefix matching algorithm used for routing tables for IP addresses
* Implementation of the dictionary
* Pattern searching
* Storing/querying XML documents
