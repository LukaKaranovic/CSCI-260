## What is it? 

A red-black tree is a self-balancing BST where the nodes contain a colour (red or black)

It has the following properties:
- Search key property: A red-black tree is a BST, so the keys are sorted like a BST.
- Colour property: Each node is either red or black.
- Root property: The root is black
- Internal property: All children of red nodes are black.
- Depth property: All the leafs nodes have the same black depth (number of black nodes along the branch from the root to the leaf node)
Note: There is a direct mapping between a red-black tree and a 2-3-4 tree.

## Main Operations: 
* lookUp - Same as BST lookUp - O(logN)
* Insert - Inserts a node into the tree - O(logN)
	- Start with a normal BST insert, insert a new leaf node as red.
	- If parent of new node is black, we are done.
	- If parent of new node is red, we have double-red problem
		- Case 1: the uncle (sibling of parent) node is black
			- Perform a trinode restructure (AVL Tree rotation)
			- **Re-coloring after rotations**:  
			* For Left Left Case and Right Right case, swap colors of grandparent and parent after rotations.
			* For Left Right Case and Right Left Case, swap colors of grandparent and inserted node after rotations.
		- Case 2: the uncle (sibling of parent) node is red (then grandparent must be black)
			- Colour parent node and uncle node black
			- Colour grandparent node red, propagate double-red problem to grandparent
	* Performance: at most one trinode restructure and O(logN) recolouring.
* Remove - removes a node from the tree - O(logN)
	- Find the victim node to delete
	- If victim node has two children, swap it with its in-order successor node v 
		- Note: v has no left child
	- Remove v, place its right child r in its position 
		- Note: r can be null, null pointers are considered black
	- Case 1: if v is red, then its right child r must be black
		- No changes, done
	- Case 2: if v’s right child r is red, v must be black
		- Colour r black, done
	- Case 3: if v is black and its right child r is also black
		- Colour r ‘double-black’, and we have an underflow problem
		- Subcase 1: sibling of r, y, is black and has a red child z
			- Perform a trinode restructure, done
		- Subcase 2: sibling of r, y, is black and both of y’s children are black
			- If y and r’s parent node x is red
				- Colour x black, colour y red, colour r black, done
			- If x is black
				- Colour y red, colour r black, colour x ‘double black’
				- Propagate the double black problem to 
		- Subcase 3: sibling of r, y, is red (y and r’s parent must be black)
			- Perform a rotation adjustment, and reduce this case to case 1 or case 2
    * Performance: at most one trinode restructure, 1 adjustment, and O(logN) recolouring

## Ways to implement (with code): 
Since we have to keep track of the new node’s parent and grandparent nodes for insertion/deletion, parent pointers are a good idea.
- Or we can use a stack to store the traversal on our way down the tree.  

### pex2 Implementation:
This is my implementation of insert for pex2, I used a stack instead of parent pointers. There are two functions: insert and restore. 
#### Insert main part (like BST)
- Insert does a normal BST insert and stores the traversal into a stack. 
- Restore handles the double-red problem.
- If the colour is false, it is red. If the colour is true, it is black.

## Typical applications:
* Can be used to efficiently index data in databases
* Can be used to efficiently implement graph algorithms
* Used in AI algorithms, such as decision trees and game trees
* Used in cryptography algorithms, like hash trees and Merkle trees
