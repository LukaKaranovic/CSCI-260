## What is it? 
A data structure that commonly implements dictionaries. It uses randomization in its structure.
- It assumes that random number generation is efficient in any computer system (not computationally expensive)
* It allows for efficient search, insertion, and deletion of elements in a sorted list.

Elements are organized in layers (linked list style), with each layer having a smaller number of elements than the one below it. 
The bottom layer is a regular linked list, while the layers above it contain ‘skipping’ links that allow for fast navigation.
The expected worst case performance of a skip list is similar to that of an AVL tree - O(logN).
## Main Operations: 
Search - searches for a key and returns its node position - O(N)
- Searches on the top layer until the next element in that layer is greater than key, then drops down and repeats the process until on the bottom layer.
Lookup - uses search function but returns data paired with key - O(N)
Insert - inserts a new node into the skip list - O(logN)
- Does coin flipping technique to see how many layers this element will go on (or how tall its ‘tower’ is)
- May need an ‘insert to layer above’ helper function
Remove - removes a node from the skip list - O(logN)
- Have to delete the whole tower and adjust pointers for each level
## Ways to implement (with code): 
Skip lists are implemented using a technique called ‘coin flipping’:
- A random number is generated for each insertion to determine the number of layers the new element will occupy; on average, each element will be in log(n) layers, where n is the number of elements in the bottom layer.
- This is because its a ½ chance for an element to go to the next level, so to go up 3 levels, you need to ‘win’ the coin flip 3 times in a row, so this is a ⅛ chance
	- I.e. heads -> increase tower by 1 level, tails = stop growing tower. If 4 gets inserted and flips heads twice in a row, then tails, then 4 is on the bottom 3 layers of the skip list.

## Typical applications:
* Skip lists are a **probabilistic alternative to balanced trees.** They are simple to implement and can support operations with the same asymptotic complexities as tree-based counterparts
* Can apply in the same way as a lot of trees would be applied, but easier to implement.
