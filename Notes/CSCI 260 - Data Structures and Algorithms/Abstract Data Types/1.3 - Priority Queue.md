## What is it? 
* Stores a collection of <key, item> pair elements. Where the key is the ‘priority’ for which the queue is sorted by. 

## Main Operations: 
- Insert: inserts a new element into the queue    
- removeMin: removes the element with the highest priority key from queue
- minKey: finds the value of the highest priority key
- minItem: finds the data item of the highest priority element
- size, isEmpty, isFull, etc.

## Ways to implement (with code): 
- Unsorted list (array or linked list)
	- insert - O(1)
	- removeMin - O(N)
- Sorted array 
	- insert - O(N)
	- removeMin - O(1)
- Heap 
	- insert - O(logN)
	- removeMin - O(logN)

* Implemented using unsorted array:

##  Typical applications: 
- To-do lists
- CPU scheduling
- Event-driven simulation (customers waiting in a queue)
