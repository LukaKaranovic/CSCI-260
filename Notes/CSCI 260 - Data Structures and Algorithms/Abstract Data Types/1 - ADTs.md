## Abstract Data Type (ADT): 
A mathematical model for data types, where a data type is defined by its behaviour from the POV of a user of the data, specifically in terms of the possible values of data, operations on that data, and the behaviour of these operations. 

### Data Structure:  
A data structure is a concrete representation of data from the point of view of an implementer.
### Concrete data structures: 
A concrete data structure is a specific implementation of an abstract data type (ADT) that describes how data is stored and how operations are performed in a particular programming environment

Examples:
* Arrays
* Structs
* Pointer-based lists
### Purpose: 
To introduce various abstract data types and their associated algorithms so that you can write _correct, efficient, robust, elegant_ and _re-usable_ programs to solve problems.
* Correctness: per specifications
* Efficiency: by choosing and using proper concrete data structures and good algorithms
* Robust: reasonable and sufficient exception handling
* Elegancy: easily understandable, maintainable and evolvable code
* Re-usability: modularized implementation, can easily plug and play in other projects

## Abstract vs. Concrete
Abstract - what goal will we achieve?
Concrete - how will we achieve our goal?

Example: 
* ADT - vehicle
* CDS - cars, trucks, motorcycles
