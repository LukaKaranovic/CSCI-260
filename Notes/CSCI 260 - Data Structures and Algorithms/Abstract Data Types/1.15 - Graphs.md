## What is it?
- A set V of vertices (nodes) representing a set of objects.
- A multi-set E of edges (arcs), pairs of vertices from V, Representing connections or relationships between pairs of objects represented by the vertices from V.
### Definitions/Terms:
- **Edge:** <u, v>, where u, v is in V; u and v are called end vertices or end points;
- **Directed edge:** ordered pair <u, v> where <u, v> is not the same as <v, u> u is called origin and v is called destination;
- **Undirected edge:** unordered pair <u, v> is the same as <v, u>, sometimes denoted as {u, v}
- **Symmetric relation:** (e.g. bi-directional road map) if A is connected to B, then B must be connected a road to A. Undirected edge can be used to represent such a relation.
- **Asymmetric relation:** (e.g., report to) if A reports to B, usually B does not report to A. So directed edge is necessary to represent this kind of relation.
- **Degree:** number of neighbours (adjacent vertices) a vertex has.
- **Undirected graph:** a graph that contains only undirected edges
- **Directed graph:** a graph that contains only directed edges
	- Outgoing edges - an edge that points from the vertex to another vertex
	- Incoming edges - an edge that points to the vertex from another vertex
	- Out-degree - number of outcoming edges on a node
	- In-degree - number of incoming edges on a node
- **Mixed graph:** a graph that contains both undirected and directed edges
- **Unweighted graph:** all edges has the same weight (usually just 1)
- **Weighted graph:** each edge has a weight, the weights of the edges may be different.
- **Adjacent:** two vertices, which are end points of a same edge, are adjacent.
- **Simple graph:** graphs with neither parallel edges nor self-loops;
- **Walk:** a sequence of edges that starts at a vertex and ends at a vertex.
- **Cycle:** a path starts and ends at the same vertex;
- **Path:** each vertex in the walk is distinct;
- **Simple cycle:** each vertex, except the start and end one is distinct;
- **Sub graph:** a graph that contains vertices and edges of the original graph.
- **Connected graph:** all vertices in the graph are connected.
- **Tree:** connected and acyclic graph

## Main Operations:
- Graph queries
    - Number of vertices
    - Number of edges
    - Iterator of vertices
    - Iterator of edges
    - IncidentEdges(v) - lists edges with vertex v as an endpoint in them
    - EndVertices(e) - lists the two vertices that are endpoints of the edge e
    - AreAdjacent(v, w) - checks if two vertices v and w are adjacent
- Graph updates
    - InsertVertex(v) - inserts a vertex into the graph
    - InsertEdge(v, w, e) - inserts an edge with the endpointsd v and w, and edge struct e into the graph
    - RemoveVertex(v) - removes vertex v from the graph.
    - RemoveEdge(e) - removes edge e from the graph.
    - SetDirectionFrom(e, v) - changes direction of edge
    - SetDirectionTo(e, v)
## Ways to implement:
1. Set of vertices + set of edges
2. Set of vertices + adjacency matrix
3. Set of vertices + adjacency list
