## What is it? 
- A binary tree storing <key, item> pairs in its nodes. Has two main properties:
	1. For every node v other than the root, v’s parents have the same or higher priority than v (heap order).
	2. Structure-wise it is a complete binary tree (always inserted in next spot).
- Can have min-heap or max-heap
    * Min-heap - higher in the tree -> node has smaller value
    * Max-heap - higher in the tree -> node has larger value 
## Main Operations: 
- Insert: adds a new element to the heap while maintain heap property
- extractMin: removes minimum element from heap (highest priority in priority queue)    
- Heapify: converts a binary tree into a heap
- findMax, upheap and downheap helper functions to help maintain heap property after insert/remove
## Ways to implement (with code): 
- Array-based: storing a binary tree in an array
### Insert with upheap and downheap (from assignment 1):

## Typical applications: 
- Commonly used to implement priority queues.
- Heapsort uses a heap to sort an array.
