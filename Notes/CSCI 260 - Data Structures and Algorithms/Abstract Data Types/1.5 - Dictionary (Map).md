## What is it? 
- A set of objects (<key, value> pairs) where each object can be uniquely identified by its key.
    
## Main Operations: 
- insert: inserts a new <key, value> pair into the dictionary
- remove: removes a <key. value> pair from dictionary by its key
- lookUp: finds the key and returns the value associated with that key    
- isFull, isEmpty, size, etc.

## Ways to implement (with code): 
- Unsorted list (array or linked list):
	- lookUp - O(N)
	- insert - O(1)
	- remove - O(1)
    
- Sorted array:
	- lookUp - O(logN)
	- insert - O(N)
	- remove - O(N)
    
- Hash table 
	- lookUp - O(1)
	- insert - O(1)
	- remove - O(1)

- Binary search tree (or AVL tree)
    - lookUp - O(logN) or O(h)
	- insert - O(logN) or O(h)
	- remove - O(logN) or O(h)
    
## Typical applications: 
- A dictionary (lol), storing data and being able to easily look it up by key
