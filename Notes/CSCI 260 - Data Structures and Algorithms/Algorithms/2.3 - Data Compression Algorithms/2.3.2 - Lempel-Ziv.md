## Lempel-Ziv Encoding Algorithm:
1. Initialize the dictionary to contain all blocks of length one character
   in the alphabet;
2. Create an empty code string Y;
3. curWord = longest block W which has appeared in the dictionary;
4. Y = Y + curWord's index in the dictionary;
5. preWord = curWord;
6. Repeat until reach the end of the string X:
   6.1 curWord = longest block W which has appeared in the dictionary;
   6.2 Y = Y + curWord's index in the dictionary;
   6.3 Encode curWord by W's index in the dictionary;
   6.4 codeWord = preWord + first symbol of curWord;
   6.5 If the dictionary is not full and codeWord is not in the dictionary,
       then Add codeWord into the dictionary;
   6.6 preWord = curWord;
## Lempel-Ziv Decoding Algorithm:
1. Initialize the dictionary to contain all blocks of length one character
   in the alphabet;
2. Create an empty message string X;
3. Read the first code C;
4. curWord = Dictionary\[C];
5. X = X + curWord;
6. preWord = curWord;
7. Repeat until reach the end of the code string Y:
   7.1 read the next code C;
   7.2 curWord = Dictionary\[C];
   7.3 X = X + curWord;
   7.4 codeWord = preWord + first symbol of curWord;
   7.5 If the dictionary is not full and codeWord is not in the dictionary,
       then Add codeWord into the dictionary;
   7.6 preWord = curWord;
