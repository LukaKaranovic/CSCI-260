1. Make a table and count the frequency of every character in the alphabet in the string.
2. Sort the table by frequency.

For the tree:
1. Take the two lowest frequency elements in the list, put them in the tree. 
2. Add their frequencies up and make a new node with the sum of those two, make it the parent of those two nodes AND put a copy of it in the table.
3. Repeat step 1 and 2 until there is nothing left to insert
	1. If you pull out a node already in the tree, then make the other node its sibling and the new node its parent.
4. When the tree is done, label each left edge with a 0, and each right edge with a 1.

Theorem: Huffman's algorithm always produces optimal code trees.

Assuming that the symbols in a message string X have independent probability to appear, then Huffman encoding is the optimal one. But the above assumption is rarely true in natural languages.

Huffman encoding also requires apriori knowledge about the frequencies of the character appearance in a message. Sometimes, we don't have this knowledge.

In natural languages, many words and phrases are repeated sometimes. Lempel-Ziv algorithm tries to take advantage of this feature.

## Huffman Code and Tree Example (WA2)
**Given the following text string:**
“huffman encoding algorithm uses optimized variable length bit strings to encode characters in a given string x over some alphabet. the optimization is based on the frequencies of the characters used in string x. the basic idea of the optimization is to use fewer digits to represent the characters with high frequencies. it is a greedy algorithm.”
