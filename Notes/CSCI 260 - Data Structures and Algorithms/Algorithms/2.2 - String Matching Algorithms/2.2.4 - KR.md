**Heuristics:** if two string's hash codes are different, these two strings can't be identical.

A practically useful hash function must be efficiently computable, highly discriminating, and easily computable from H(s\[j to j+m-1]), s\[j], and s\[j+m].

This algorithm is especially useful if there are more than one pattern strings, e.g., catching plagiarism.

Uses a method called rolling hash, where we calculate the hash of the characters of string s of the length of string p, then we subtract the first character hash value from the hash and add the next character hash value to it.
