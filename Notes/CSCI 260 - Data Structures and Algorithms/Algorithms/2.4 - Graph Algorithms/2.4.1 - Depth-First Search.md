Depth First Search (or DFS) for a graph is similar toÂ the **depth first traversal of a tree.** 

Like trees, we traverse all adjacent vertices one by one. When we traverse an adjacent vertex, we completely finish the traversal of all vertices reachable through that adjacent vertex. 

After we finish traversing one adjacent vertex and its reachable vertices, we move to the next adjacent vertex and repeat the process. 

This is similar to a tree, where we first completely traverse the left subtree and then move to the right subtree. The key difference is that, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles (a node may be visited more than once). To avoid processing a node multiple times, we use a boolean array named 'visited'.

DFS is a backtracking algorithm.

### Typical Applications of Graph Traversal
* Testing connectivity
- Detecting cycles in G
- Finding a path between a pair of vertices
- Crawl the web
- Systematically examining each vertex and edge in G, etc.
