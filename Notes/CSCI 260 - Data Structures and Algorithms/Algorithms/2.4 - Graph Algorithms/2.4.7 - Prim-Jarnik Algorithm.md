The **Prim-Jarnik algorithm** is another greedy algorithm used to find the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a connected, undirected graph. 

Unlike Kruskal's algorithm, Prim's algorithm grows the MST **one vertex at a time**, always adding the smallest-weight edge that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside it.

## Algorithm
1. **Choose a starting vertex**  
	* Arbitrarily pick any vertex as the starting point of the MST.
2. **Initialize data structures**
    - Keep a set of vertices already included in the MST.
    - Maintain a priority queue (or a min-heap) of edges containing the starting vertex as an endpoint, prioritizing edges with the smallest weight.
3. **Grow the MST**  
    * Repeat the following until all vertices are included in the MST:
	    - Extract the smallest-weight edge from the priority queue.
	    - Add the edge and its endpoint (if not already in the MST) to the MST.
	    - Add all edges from the newly added vertex to the priority queue, as long as they connect to vertices outside the MST.
4. **Stop when MST is complete**  
    * The MST will include V-1 edges (where V is the number of vertices).

### Time Complexity
- **Adjacency list with a min-heap:** O(Elog‚Å°V)
- **Adjacency matrix:** O(V^2)

### Advantages
- Works well for dense graphs.
- Does not require sorting of edges upfront.
### Disadvantages
- Implementation can be complex for sparse graphs unless optimized.
### Applications
- Network design (e.g., laying cables, water supply systems).
- Constructing efficient roadmaps or electrical grids.
- Used in real-time scenarios where adding one element at a time is beneficial.
