Breadth First Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm. 

It begins with a node, then first traverses all its adjacent nodes. Once all adjacent are visited, then their adjacent are traversed. 

This is different from DFS in a way that the closest vertices are visited before others. We mainly traverse vertices level by level.

A lot of popular graph algorithms like [Dijkstra’s shortest path](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/), [Kahn’s Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/topological-sorting-indegree-based-solution/), and [Prim’s algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/prims-minimum-spanning-tree-mst-greedy-algo-5/) are based on BFS. BFS itself can be used to detect cycles in directed and undirected graphs, find the shortest path in an unweighted graph, and solve many more problems.

### Typical Applications of Graph Traversal
* Testing connectivity
- Detecting cycles in G
- Finding a path between a pair of vertices
- Crawl the web
- Systematically examining each vertex and edge in G, etc.
