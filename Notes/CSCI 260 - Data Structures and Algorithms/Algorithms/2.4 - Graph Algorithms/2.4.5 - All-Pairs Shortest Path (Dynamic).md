A dynamic programming algorithm by S. Warshall, R.W. Floyd and P.Z. Ingerman -- works as long as there is no negative weight cycles.

This algorithm uses dynamic programming to compute shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph. It works for both directed and undirected graphs and supports negative edge weights (but no negative weight cycles).

### Key Idea
The algorithm incrementally improves the shortest paths by considering whether including an intermediate node k improves the path between two nodes i and j.

- **Time Complexity**: O(V^3), where V is the number of nodes.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V^2), for the distance matrix.
