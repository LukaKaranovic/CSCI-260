## Directed Acyclic Graph
**Definition:** Consider a directed acyclic graph G = <V, E>, a topological sort of the vertices of G is a sequence S = {v1, v2, ..., vn} in which each element of vi in V appears exactly once. For pair of distinct vertices vi and vj in the sequence S, if <vi, vj> is an edge in G, then i < j in S.

## Algorithm
Topological sorting for **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u-v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

Note: Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

The first vertex in topological sorting is always a vertex with an in-degree of 0 (no incoming edges). The sort basically sorts vertices by their in-degree.

Output from example graph: 5 4 2 3 1 0

There can be more than one topological sorting of a graph. 
* E.g. for this graph, "4 5 2 3 1 0" works.

## Explanation of Constraints
![[Pasted image 20241208162415.png]]
If we look at the example graph again, we can identify constraints.
Let's analyze this graph:
#### Nodes:
- The graph contains six nodes: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.
#### Directed edges:
- From `5` to `0` and `2`.
- From `4` to `0` and `1`.
- From `0` to `3`.
- From `1` to `3`.
- From `2` to `3`.
### Constraints for topological sorting:
- A node must appear before any nodes it directs to does. For instance:
    - `5` and `4` must come before `0`.
    - `5` must come before `2`, and `4` must come before `1`.
    - `0, 1, 2` must come before `3`.

Here are all the valid topological sortings:
