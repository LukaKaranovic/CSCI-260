Given a positively weighted graph and a source vertex in the graph, find the shortest paths from the source to all the other vertices in the given graph.

**Time Complexity**:
- O(V^2) for a simple implementation.
- O((V+E)log⁡V) with a priority queue (min-heap).
## Pseudocode
![[Pasted image 20241208163813.png]]
* The code calculates the shortest distance but doesn’t calculate the path information. 
* Create a parent array, update the parent array when distance is updated and use it to show the shortest path from source to different vertices.
