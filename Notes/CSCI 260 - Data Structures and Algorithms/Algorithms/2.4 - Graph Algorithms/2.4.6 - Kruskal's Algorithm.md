## Minimum spanning trees
- A **spanning tree** of a connected graph is a tree that contains every vertex of the graph, and the edge set of the tree is the subset of the edge set of the graph
- The **minimum spanning tree** is a spanning tree with the smallest total weight of the edges.
- If the graph is an unweighted graph, then the minimum spanning tree is the tree with only the discovery edges while traversing the graph.
## Algorithm
Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a connected, undirected graph. 

1. **Sort all edges by weight**  
	* Arrange the edges of the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.
	* This is typically done with a heap priority queue for the highest efficiency.
1. **Initialize the forest**  
	* Treat each vertex as its own separate tree (a "forest" of single-vertex trees).
2. **Iterate through the edges**  
	* For each edge in the sorted list:
	    - Check if adding the edge to the current forest would form a cycle. If not, add it to the MST.
		    - **You can check this by checking whether or not both endpoints of the edge are in the same tree or not.**
	    - Use a **disjoint-set (union-find) data structure** to efficiently check for cycles.
3. **Stop when MST is formed**  
    * Continue until the MST includes exactly V-1 edges (where V is the number of vertices in the graph).

### Time Complexity:
* **Sorting edges:** O(ElogE), where E is the number of edges.
* **Union-Find operations:** O(Eα(V)), where α(V) is the **inverse Ackermann function.**
	* Nearly constant for practical input sizes.
* **Overall complexity**: O(ElogE) because of the sorting edges.

### Advantages
- Simple and intuitive.
- Works well for sparse graphs (few edges).
### Disadvantages
- Inefficient for dense graphs unless an optimized data structure is used.
- Requires sorting of edges upfront.
### Applications
- Network design (e.g., laying cables or pipelines).
- Clustering in machine learning.
- Constructing road maps or communication networks efficiently.
