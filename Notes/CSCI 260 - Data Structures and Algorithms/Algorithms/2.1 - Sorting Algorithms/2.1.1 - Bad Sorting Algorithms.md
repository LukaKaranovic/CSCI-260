All these algorithms are in O(N^2) time, they aren't good but they are easy to implement.
## Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. 

This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity are quite high.

## Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list. It is like sorting playing cards in your hands. 

You split the cards into two groups: the sorted cards and the unsorted cards. Then, you pick a card from the unsorted group and put it in the right place in the sorted group.

## Selection Sort
Selection Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. It sorts an array by repeatedly selecting the **smallest (or largest)** element from the unsorted portion and swapping it with the first unsorted element. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.
