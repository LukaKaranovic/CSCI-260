These are comparison based sorting algorithms that are good, as their worst case is O(NlogN).
## Merge Sort
Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that follows the **divide and conquer** approach. It works by recursively dividing the input array into smaller subarrays and sorting those subarrays then merging them back together to obtain the sorted array.

In simple terms, we can say that the process of ****merge sort**** is to divide the array into two halves, sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves back together. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

## Quick Sort
Quick sort is a sorting algorithm based on the **divide and conquer** that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot by placing the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array.
1. **Choose a Pivot:** Select an element from the array as the pivot. The choice of pivot can vary (e.g., first element, last element, random element, or median).
2. **Partition the Array:** Rearrange the array around the pivot. After partitioning, all elements smaller than the pivot will be on its left, and all elements greater than the pivot will be on its right. The pivot is then in its correct position, and we obtain the index of the pivot.
3. **Recursively Call:** Recursively apply the same process to the two partitioned sub-arrays (left and right of the pivot).
4. **Base Case:** The recursion stops when there is only one element left in the sub-array, as a single element is already sorted.

## Heap Sort
Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on the heap data structure. It can be seen as an optimization over selection sort.

We first find the max (or min) element and swap it with the last (or first). We repeat the same process for the remaining elements. 

In Heap Sort, we are using a binary heap so that we can quickly find and move the max element in O(LogN) instead of O(N) and hence achieve the O(NLogN) time complexity.

## Shell Sort

Shell sort is mainly a variation of insertion sort. In insertion sort, we move elements only one position ahead. When an element has to be moved far ahead, many movements are involved. 

The idea of shell sort is to allow the exchange of far items. In Shell sort, we make the array h-sorted for a large value of h. We keep reducing the value of h until it becomes 1. 
* An array is said to be h-sorted if all sublists of every h’th element are sorted.

**Algorithm:**
1. Start  
2. Initialize the value of gap size, say h.  
3. Divide the list into smaller sub-part. Each must have equal intervals to h.  
4. Sort these sub-lists using insertion sort.  
5. Repeat this step 2 until the list is sorted.  
6. Print a sorted list.  
7. Stop.
