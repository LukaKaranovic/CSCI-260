## Bucket Sort
Bucket sort is a sorting technique that involves dividing elements into various groups, or buckets. These buckets are formed by uniformly distributing the elements. Once the elements are divided into buckets, they can be sorted using any other sorting algorithm. Finally, the sorted elements are gathered together in an ordered fashion.

Create ****n**** empty buckets (Or lists) and do the following for every array element arr[i].
- Insert arr\[i] into bucket\[n*array\[i]]
- Sort individual buckets using insertion sort.
- Concatenate all sorted buckets.

## Radix Sort
Radix Sort is a linear sorting algorithm that sorts elements by processing them digit by digit. It is an efficient sorting algorithm for integers or strings with fixed-size keys. 

Rather than comparing elements directly, Radix Sort distributes the elements into buckets based on each digit’s value. By repeatedly sorting the elements by their significant digits, from the least significant to the most significant, Radix Sort achieves the final sorted order.
