## Internal sorting conditions:
- Data stored in continuous storage space (array)
- Fully comparable keys
- Randomly accessible to every element (in main memory)

## External sorting conditions:
- Input data amount too large for main memory
- Input data stored in sequential storage
- Output sorted sequence to sequential storage
### External sorting algorithm criteria:
- To be able to access data in sequential order
- Minimize number of times an item is accessed from disk
## External sorting algorithms:
1. Break a large data file into shorter "runs" of data, so that each run can fit to main memory and be sorted (using internal sorting algorithm).
2. Merge two or more runs (depends on how many input buffers there are) together into a longer run.
3. Repeat step 2 until there is only one sorted file.

### Performance:
- If M records can be sorted in memory, and the file has N records, the number of initial runs is N/M.
- If we can merge T runs in each pass, then we need ceiling(log_T(N/M)) passes to merge all runs together since each pass reduces the number of runs by T.
